# hello-world
This is a description of this repository.

I am a beginning developer on his first project, with only intermediate level knowledge of HTML and CSS (and literally no JavaScript). 
The website I'm making looks weird, despite the fact that my code is working fine (I think it might just be me though). 
I'm not a pro-designer or developer, so I'm hoping to be able to delve into some great projects and learn valuable and interesting code for my future projects.
